Info for joining Hip Hippocampi for PSY1210

Hi all! So I've named the group (when you click on the link off Quercus) for PS1 "Hip Hippocampi". Let me know if you have trouble joining the group. 

In the submission branch, I've created a start to the story under <OurStory.txt>. Everyone should clone local repositories of the submission branch, and commit changes 3 times. 

Once everyone is done their bit, we can all read through it one more time to make sure the story (sorta) makes sense, and that we've all committed enough changes. Then I'll go ahead and make a pull request on the original repository to turn in the assignment.

- Natalia :)
